# 🏰 Surge of Power - Templar's Torrent

**Surge of Power - Templar's Torrent** is a fast-paced, point-and-click strategy game where players battle for dominance in a chaotic free-for-all battlefield. Manage resources, produce units, and outwit opponents — all while fending off a wild third-party goblin faction that shows no mercy!

## 🎮 Features

- ⚔️ **Real-Time Free-for-All Combat**: Face off in skirmishes with multiple players (human or AI-controlled).
- 🏗️ **Direct Unit Production**: No card decks or complicated tech trees — just build, deploy, and fight!
- 💰 **Simplified Resource Management**: Gather and spend quickly. Keep the pace fast and the strategy sharp.
- 🗺️ **Small Tactical Maps**: Designed for short and intense matches.
- 🟦 **Control Points**: Secure them for tactical advantages, but remember — they’re optional for victory!
- 👹 **Chaotic Neutral Faction**: A goblin horde attacks everyone, adding an unpredictable twist to every battle.
- 🏆 **Victory Conditions**:
  - Capture and hold enemy bases
  - Or destroy all enemy strongholds to win

## 🕹️ Gameplay

Each player starts with a base and a small pool of resources. During the match, players must:

- Gather resources from nearby nodes
- Produce units directly from their base
- Attack enemy players or defend against them
- Be wary of the goblin faction, which will attack indiscriminately!

Use control points to gain vision, speed boosts, or reinforcements — but don’t rely on them to win.
